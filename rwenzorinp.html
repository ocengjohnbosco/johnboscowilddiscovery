<h1>Rwenzori Mountains National Park Uganda</h1>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p class="paran">Also known as the fabled Mountains of the Moon. Rwenzori Mountains lie in western Uganda along the Uganda-Congo border. The equatorial snow peaks include the third highest point in Africa, while the lower slopes are blanketed in moorland, bamboo and rich, moist montane forest. Huge tree-heathers and colorful mosses are draped across the mountainside with giant lobelias and “everlasting flowers”, creating an enchanting, fairytale scene. The national park hosts 70 mammals and 217 bird species including 19 Albertine Rift endemics, as well as some of the world’s rarest vegetation.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p class="paran">The park was gazetted in 1991 and was recognized as a World Heritage site in 1994 and Ramsar site in 2008. It’s highest point is 5,109m above sea level on Mt Stanley’s Margherita Peak. Mt. Stanley is bisected by the border with the DR Congo. The Rwenzori is not volcanic like East Africa’s other major mountains but is a block of rock up faulted through the floor of the Western Rift Valley. The Rwenzoris were christened the “Mountains of the Moon” by the Alexandrine geographer Ptolemy in AD 150.</p>

<p class="paran">The explorer Henry Stanley placed the Rwenzori on the map on 24th May 1888. He labeled it ‘Ruwenzori’, a local name which he recorded as meaning “Rain-Maker” or “Cloud-King.” Mountain Rwenzori National Park protects the highest parts of the 120km-long and 65km-wide Rwenzori mountain range. The Rwenzoris are the world-class hiking and mountaineering destination. A nine – to twelve-day trek will get skilled climbers to the summit of Margherita, the highest peak.</p>

<h2>Rwenzori Mountains National Park</h2>
<p class="paran">For those who prefer something a little less strenuous, neighboring Bakonzo villages offer nature walks, homestead visits home cultural performances and accommodation, including home-cooked local cuisine. Enquire with Wild Discoveries Safaris’ team of tour experts about a Rwenzori Mountain Safari and how best to organise for you the best itinerary that fits your style and Budget.</p>

<p class="paran">The park is home to 70 species of mammal, including six Albertine Rift endemics; 12 are endemic to the park and three are rare species. Other mammals include the elephant, chimpanzee, Rwenzori otter and leopard. Though wildlife is difficult to spot in the dense forest, do look out for primates such as colobus (Angola and black-and-white varieties are both present) and blue monkeys; small antelope such as bushbucks; and unusual reptiles such as the three-horned chameleon.</p>

<h2>Tourism and Activities in the Park</h2>
<p class="paran">The park is owned by the Ugandan government through Uganda National Parks. It is protected, although extraction may be sanctioned by a board of trustees. Kasese, 437 km west of Uganda’s capital Kampala, is the gateway to the park. The town has hotels and lodges, while the park has camping, a good trail network and huts for hikers. The park has excellent trekking and climbing opportunities with spectacular views and unusual scenery. The major tourist activity here is mountain climbing.</p>

<h2>Equatorial snow peaks</h2>
<p class="paran">Rwenzori Mountains comprise six distinct mountains located miles north of the equator, the highest of these – Mounts Stanley (5,109m), Speke (4,890m) and Baker (4,843m) all bearing permanent snow and glaciers. The snow peaks can be reached by hiking the Central Circuit and Kilembe Trails.</p>

<h2>Land of the Triffids</h2>
<p class="paran">The misty, boggy, glacier-carved valleys of the high Rwenzori form a strange botanical world inhabited by triffid-sized forms of lobelia, heather and groundsel, crisp “everlasting flowers,” garishly coloured mosses and gnarled trees draped with curtains of lichen. The result is an otherworldly setting which, over the years, has been compared to the forests of the Jabberwock, the Seven Dwarves and, inevitably, Tolkein’s Middle Earth. These strange plants rank among the world’s botanical treasures, being found only on the highest mountains of East Africa.</p>

<h2>Rwenzori Mountains Trek</h2>
<h2>Lakes</h2>
<p class="paran">There are over 20 lakes in Rwenzori Mountains National Park. The lowest and most accessible is Lake Mahoma (2,651m) in the bird-rich forest of the Central Circuit. The beautiful Lake Bujuku lies at the head of the deep, glacier carved Bujuku valley in the shadow of Mounts Stanley, Baker and Speke. In the Nyamwamba Valley, ascended by the Kilembe Trail, dams created by glacial moraine have created a string of eight delightful lakes. Several rivers and streams orginate from the mountain, forming lifelines for the flora and flora in the flood plains and supporting local communities.</p>

<h2>Ruboni</h2>
<p class="paran">Found at the southeastern foot of the Rwenzori Mountains is the trailhead for the seven-day Central Circuit to the high peaks. It is also the starting point for hill walks, bird watching and nature treks and walks through the traditional homesteads of the local Bakonzo community.</p>

<h2>Bulemba</h2>
<p class="paran">The remains of Rwenzururu’s first King, Isaiah Mukirania Kibanzanga, who is believed to have saved the Bakonzo tribe from the Batooro oppression are found in the Bulembe houses. Each year on 2nd September, every Mukonzo attends the pilgrimage to this sacred site to make sacrifices</p>

<h2>Rwenzori Turaco View Camp Site</h2>
<p class="paran">The tiny village of Mihunga faces the craggy, snow-capped peaks of Rwenzori Mountains. The Bakonzo tribe has lived here for over 300 years with no electricity or running water, and this community has adapted its way of life to the climate and steep green hillsides of the Rwenzori foothills. Mihunga‘s community tourism group, Turaco View, takes visitors on a cultural tour of the village. This includes a demonstration by a traditional healer, whose herb-based concoctions are believed to cure many ailments.</p>

<h2>Bulemba-Ihandiro Cultural Trail</h2>
<p class="paran">Through the fascinating six to seven hour trail through the holy valley and other sites of great cultural significance to the Bakonzo tribe. A community guide will introduce you to the traditional healer, explaining his powers, known as muhima; and to the local blacksmith, who will reveal the spiritual significance of the traditional Bakonzo stool. The trail then takes you across the Kamusonge River whose waters are believed to be sweet and quick to quench the thirst. There is a break in a hut to enjoy the glorious mountain views and shelter from the equatorial sun.</p>

<h2>Kilembe Trail</h2>
<p class="paran">The recently reopened Kilembe Trail ascends the southern slopes of the Rwenzori from a trailhead at Kilembe near the town of Kasese. The route along the lovely Nyamwamba Valley passes glacial lakes and some stunning viewpoints before joining the Central Circuit at Lake Kitandara. The standard route scales Mount Baker though the scenery makes shorter treks rewarding enough.</p>

<h2>Rwenzori Activities</h2>
<h2>Birding</h2>
<p class="paran">The montane forest has the greatest birding opportunities; understandably, few species choose to make their home in the inhospitable world of the high Rwenzori. Bee-eaters, Robins, Sunbirds, Barbets, Rwenzori Turaco and Long-eared Owl; while higher up on the slopes, Bearded Vultures, Swifts and Black Eagles may be seen circling for prey.</p>

<h2>Hiking and Nature Walks</h2>
<p class="paran">The park provides opportunity for nature walks within the central circuit zone. These include trails up to Lake Mahooma and Buraro chimp forest; walks through the communities of Kichamba to reach the Karangura ridge; and hiking to Bundibugo area through Bwamba pass. Bwamba Pass,before a road was built in 1938 to link Fort Portal with the remote town of Bundibugyo, local people followed the most direct route between these settlements – a tough, 1,500m high trek over the steep north Rwenzori ridge, known as the Bwamba Pass.</p>

<h2>Mountain/Volcano Climbing</h2>
<p class="paran">The Central Circuit Trail: This challenging, seven-day climb provides a circular tour of the high Rwenzori. From the trailhead at Mihunga, the route ascends the Bujuku Valley via Nyabitaba for acclimatization before reaching the peaks. Hikers joining the Central Circuit after Bujuku will traverse the Scott Elliot and Freshfield passes to descend through the Mubuku Valley. Climbers can scale the snow peaks though many consider the exceptional scenery ample reward for their exertions.</p>
