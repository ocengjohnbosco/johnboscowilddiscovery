<h1>Ziwa Rhino Sanctuary Uganda</h1>
<h1>Overview</h1>

<p class="paran">Ziwa Rhino Sanctuary and Wildlife Ranch district is the proud home of the only wild rhinos in Uganda and is located in Nakasongola. The Rhino reintroduction is a project of Rhino Fund Uganda and Uganda Wildlife Authority. The sanctuary offers a secure place where rhino populations can be expanded by breeding, protected from human and non-human predators and gradually re-introduced into Uganda’s national parks, while at the same time, allowing the public to enjoy these majestic animals</p>

<p class="paran">Ziwa Rhino Sanctuary is conveniently located 176km north of Kampala on the Gulu highway towards Murchison Falls. It is the only place where you will be able to see rhinos in the wild. The sanctuary is home to fifteen (15) southern white rhinos. The sanctuary has become increasingly popular with tourists; for rhino trekking, bird watching, nature walks and holiday relaxation. The sanctuary is home to at least 40 mammal and reptilian species including monkeys, antelopes, hippopotami, crocodiles and numerous bird species.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p class="paran">Both the Black Rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) and the White Rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum), are [indigenous] to Uganda. However, due to a number of factors, including prolonged armed human conflict, poaching and the mismanagement of their natural habitat, by 1982, both species had been wiped out in the country. Ziwa Rhino sanctuary was established in 2005 to reintroduce the southern white rhinoceros to Uganda. The long-term goal of the sanctuary is to “build a sustainable rhinoceros population and relocate rhinos back to their original habitat in Uganda’s protected areas”. As of January 2010, Ziwa Rhino Sanctuary is the only location in Uganda, where rhinos can be observed in their natural habitat.</p>

<p class="paran">Starting with a total of six animals, four that were bought from Solio Ranch in Kenya and two donated from Disney’s Animal Kingdom in Orlando, Florida, in the United States, the rhino population had grown to thirteen as of June 2013. Following the birth of another calf in April 2014 to date, the total rhino population at Ziwa Ranch rose to 30.</p>
