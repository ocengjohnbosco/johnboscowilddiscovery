<p class="paran"><b>DAY 01 : Arrival at the Entebbe International Airport.</b><br>
Welcome to Uganda the Pearl of Africa! We will warmly welcome you on arrival at the Airport and transfer you to your hotel in Entebbe where we will brief you about your safari. We will also guide you to exchange your currency.</p>

<p class="paran"><b>DAY 02 : To Uganda wildlife education centre (UWEC) & Ngamba Island (CSWCT)</b><br>
We are still in Entebbe. After breakfast we visit UWEC on the shores of the largest lake in Africa, Lake Victoria and thereafter ride on the same lake to CSWCT. At UWEC we will see a wide variety of indigenous wildlife species including chimpanzees, Rhinos, Lions, Giraffe, leopards in semi natural settings, and a wide range of free ranging birds. At CSWCT we will view the remarkable orphaned chimpanzees in their forest habitat during either a morning or afternoon feeding. You may also swim on the equator, view a neighboring fishing village, watch birds and other wildlife encounters, or just sunbathe and relax.</p>

<p class="paran"><b>DAY 03 : To Kibale Forest National Park</b><br>
Early morning we will drive to Kibale Forest National Park. We will have lunch in Fort Portal, a town named after a British Special Commissioner for Uganda Sir. Gerald Portal, whose statue graces the main road of the town. Thereafter we proceed to our overnight accommodation.</p>

<p class="paran"><b>DAY 04 : In Kibale Forest National Park</b><br>
We will start with chimpanzee trekking at 8.00am. The trekking takes about 4 hours, during which you may also get a chance to see 10 other primates and several bird and butterfly species. Kibale tropical forest is home to a number of forest wildlife, most notably 13 species of primates including chimpanzees, and 375 species of birds. After trekking we will have lunch and then visit Bigodi wetland – a community based project.</p>

<p class="paran"><b>DAY 05 : To Queen Elizabeth national park:</b><br>
Early morning we will drive to Queen Elizabeth NP. We will travel through Fort Portal and reach Mweya peninsula in Queen Elizabeth NP at about midday, with a magnificent view over Kazinga Channel. You will check in at your accommodation, have lunch, and in the late afternoon (3.00-5.00pm) we will go on a two hours launch cruise on the Kazinga channel where we will view animals and birds along the waters.</p>

<p class="paran"><b>DAY 06 : To Kyambura Gorge in Queen Elizabeth National Park</b><br>
Very early in the morning after breakfast we will go to for a 3-4 hour chimpanzee tracking in Kyambura Gorge. The chimp population is quite mobile and viewing is unpredictable but the walk is enchanting. Alternatively one can go for a nature walk in Maramagambo Forest to see other primates and visit the Blue Lake. In the afternoon we shall take a game drive to Kasenyi Kob mating ground.</p>

<p class="paran"><b>DAY 07 : To Bwindi impenetrable forest</b><br>
After breakfast we head towards the south, passing the southern sector of the national park. This part is called Ishasha sector and is famous for the tree climbing lions. While driving through a verdant countryside, you will pass traditional homesteads and enjoy panoramic views. In the afternoon arrival in Bwindi National Park, home of the endangered mountain gorillas. Dinner and overnight at selected lodge.</p>

<p class="paran"><b>DAY 08 : In Bwindi Impenetrable National Park</b><br>
We will head to the briefing point at the park headquarters and from here you will be briefed about the do’s and don’ts while in the jungle forest with the gentle Giants. You will be provided with walking sticks and you are also advised to have your lunch parked with enough drinking water. The Gorillas share with us humans 95% of their genes and staring into their pondering eyes is as overwhelming as it is awesome. After tracking we will travel back to our lodge, relax, dine and overnight.</p>

<p class="paran"><b>DAY 09 : End of Safari – Transfer to Kampala</b><br>
You will take a cup of coffee or tea before you start your return journey to Kampala. Lunch in Mbarara town thereafter have a stopover at the equator and proceed to Entebbe for the over night.</p>

<p class="paran"><b>9 Days Uganda Gorilla Safari Overview</b><br>
Uganda Gorilla Trekking is an unforgettable experience that takes you up-close with the magnificent mountain gorillas of Bwindi Forest jungle. Trek through the lush tropical rainforests in search for Mountain Gorillas, Chimpanzees, Debrassa monkeys and many more primates! Experience the pristine and unique atmosphere of the rainforests during this lifetime chimpanzee and gorilla trekking safari!</p>

<p class="paran"><b>This scheduled Uganda gorilla trekking safari starts and ends in Entebbe. We set off for the trip on the Morning of Tuesday September 5, 2017 from your Hotel in Entebbe and head toward Western Uganda on this amazing primates adventure. Register early to receive travel goodies from our team. This trip will take a minimum of 10 people. We travel by land to see the best of Uganda’s beauty and scenery, cultures & people.</b>

<p class="paran"><b>What to Expect of the Uganda Gorilla Trekking safari tour</b><br>
8:30am on the first morning you drive for Fort Portal, 320 kilometres west of the capital in the northern foothills of the Rwenzori Mountains through attractive landscape of rolling hills with tea plantations. After an early cup of coffee the second morning, you’ll accompany Kibale’s researchers and habituators into the Kibale Forest National Park as they follow chimpanzee families during their daily activities, getting them used to human presence without altering their natural behaviour.</p>

<p class="paran">On the third day after breakfast at Primate Lodge Kibale you’ll leave the Kibale Forest at a leisurely pace via the crater lakes to Kasese. The road passes through fertile agricultural land and follows the lower slopes of the Rwenzori Mountains. From Kasese, you’ll cross the equator as the road passes through the Queen Elizabeth National Park. You’ll explore the prime game viewing area of western Uganda. A network of tracks allows you to find elephant, buffalo and other animals in the grassland thickets that cover the north Kazinga area near the Mweya Peninsula. Lions and other big cats are most reliably sighted on the typical open East Africa savannah Kasenyi Plain, east of the Kasese/Mbarara highway.</p>

<p class="paran">From QENP to Buhoma, Bwindi Forest. On this scenic drive the typical East Africa savannah plains will be left behind as you climb through rolling hills and terraced fields more characteristic of Central Africa. Gorilla trekking is an unforgettable experience which more than repays the effort needed to reach Bwindi and to trek through the forest. Looking deep into the expressive brown eyes of these giants of the Bwindi Forest is surely the most exciting and moving wildlife encounter Africa has to offer.</p>

<p class="paran">Leave the northern sector of the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park via a scenic rural back road with magnificent views on rolling hills and terraced fields. The road passes through the bamboo and montane forest of the Echuya Forest Reserve. By early/mid-afternoon you’ll arrive in the town of Kisoro at the base of the Virunga Mountains in Mgahinga Gorilla National Park. After an early breakfast the next day, you’ll go in search of endangered golden monkeys in the Mgahinga National Park, spending most of the morning exploring Mgahinga’s old forest. Around midday you’ll leave Kisoro for the border with Rwanda. Once through immigration and customs, you’ll continue to Musanze (formerly Ruhengeri), overlooking the beautiful lakes Burera and Ruhondo and with breathtaking views over the Virunga volcanoes.</p>

<p class="paran">In our last days of the safari, you’ll go to find the gorillas on the Rwandan of the mountains, leaving for the Volcanoes National Park headquarters after an early breakfast. You’ll get a guide and be allocated your gorilla family before you set off into the rain forest to enjoy an hour with the gorillas. Your second gorilla trek is usually better because now you know what to expect. Afterwards, you’ll leave for Rwanda’s capital city of Kigali, where you’ll be dropped off at the Kigali Serena Hotel. You’ll be taken to the Milles Collines Hotel or ‘Hotel Rwanda’ for dinner, returning to the Kigali Serena to sleep. And that marks the end of our safari.</p>
