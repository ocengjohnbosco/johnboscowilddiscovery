<h1>Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park</h1>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p class="paran">Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park lies in southwestern Uganda on the edge of the Rift Valley and mostly know for Gorilla Trekking of the rear Mountain Gorillas. Its mist-covered hillsides are blanketed by one of Uganda’s oldest and most biologically diverse rain forests, which dates back over 25,000 years and contains almost 400 species of plants.</p>

<p class="paran">More famously, this “impenetrable forest” also protects an estimated 340 mountain gorillas – roughly half of the world’s population, including thirteen (13) habituated mountain gorilla groups that are open to tourism: Mubare; Habinyanja, Bitukura, Busingye, Bweeza, Hibinyanja, Kahungye, Mishaya, Nshongi, Oruzogo, Rushegura near Buhoma and the Nkuringo group at Nkuringo.</p>

<p class="paran">This biologically diverse region also provides shelter to a further 120 mammals, including several primate species such as Columbus monkeys, baboons and chimpanzees, as well as elephants and antelopes. There are around 348 species of birds hosted in this forest, including 23 Albertine Rift endemics.</p>

<p class="paran">The neighboring towns of Buhoma and Nkuringo both have an impressive array of luxury lodges, rustic bandas and budget campsites, as well as restaurants, craft stalls and guiding services. Opportunities abound to discover the local Bakiga and Batwa Pygmy cultures through performances, workshops and village walks.</p>

<p class="paran">Mountain Gorilla Trekking is one of the most sought after activity on most African Safari Holidays. It is restricted to the South Western parts of Uganda, specifically the border of Rwanda with Uganda and Congo. To find Mountain gorillas live in groups and keep moving from one place to another, travelers with the help of a ranger guide will follow a gorilla group path and when they do, the moment spent with them is spectacular and memorable. Thus, the definition of “Mountain Gorilla Trekking” was derived. Recommended Bwindi Safari: 3 Days Bwindi Gorilla Tracking Safari Tour & 7 Days Chimpanzee and Gorilla trekking</p>
